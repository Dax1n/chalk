        <h1>Chalk</h1>

<p>Author: <strong>Jason Baldridge</strong> (<a href="mailto:jasonbaldridge@gmail.com">jasonbaldridge@gmail.com</a>)</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Chalk is a library for natural language processing (NLP). The present version (0.1) is pretty much an exact copy of Apache OpenNLP v1.5.3 (opennlp.apache.org), except that "chalk" has been substituted for "opennlp" in the package names, and SBT is used to configure and build the project. Why do this? Basically, I would like to be able to change and extend OpenNLP using Scala and Akka, and I wanted to release the first version as essentially unchanged from OpenNLP. That makes the history of changes easier to track, and it might provide some useful examples for making Java-to-Scala transitions. Ultimately, I see this diverging substantatially from OpenNLP, and no attempt for compatibility will be made as of this breaking point. (I think the OpenNLP team is great and as one of the co-creators of OpenNLP, I am still very much interested in seeing OpenNLP evolve and improve. However, I really want to explore some ideas using Scala and Akka and figured this was the most straightforward and nimble way to move forward on it.)</p>

<p>I've called this Chalk because my son has a stuffed elephant that he named Chalk. "Chalk" obviously has a great connection to writing (and thus text processing). Of course, it also follows the what-your-kid-called-his-elephant naming convention precedent established with Hadoop. :)</p>

<p>In addition to OpenNLP, there are two other related projects. One is Scalabha (<a href="https://github.com/utcompling/Scalabha">https://github.com/utcompling/Scalabha</a>), which I started as a package for teaching Scala in computational linguistics projects, and which I may pilfer as Chalk develops. The other is Breeze, which is a Scala-based machine learning and NLP project that I've been peripherally involved with. It's a great and very general library; ultimately, I expect to bring Breeze in as a dependency and then Chalk will in some respects be an example of building an NLP library on top of the core capabilities provided by Breeze.</p>

<p>One last thing: I'm not publicizing this particular incarnation of Chalk at this point since it is really just a reference point. If you'd like to get involved, do get in touch!</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Version 1.6 of the Java 2 SDK (<a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>)</li>
</ul><h2>Configuring your environment variables</h2>

<p>The easiest thing to do is to set the environment variables <code>JAVA_HOME</code>
and <code>CHALK_DIR</code> to the relevant locations on your system. Set <code>JAVA_HOME</code>
to match the top level directory containing the Java installation you
want to use.</p>

<p>Next, add the directory <code>CHALK_DIR/bin</code> to your path. For example, you
can set the path in your <code>.bashrc</code> file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:$CHALK_DIR/bin
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have taken care of these three things, you should be able to
build and use Chalk.</p>

<h2>Building the system from source</h2>

<p>Chalk uses SBT (Simple Build Tool) with a standard directory
structure.  To build Chalk, type (in the <code>$CHALK_DIR</code> directory):</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/build update compile
</code></pre>

<p>This will compile the source files and put them in
<code>./target/classes</code>. If this is your first time running it, you will see
messages about Scala being downloaded -- this is fine and
expected. Once that is over, the Chalk code will be compiled.</p>

<p>To try out other build targets, do:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/build
</code></pre>

<p>This will drop you into the SBT interface. To see the actions that are
possible, hit the TAB key. (In general, you can do auto-completion on
any command prefix in SBT, hurrah!)</p>

<p>To make sure all the tests pass, do:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/build test
</code></pre>

<p>Documentation for SBT is at <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">http://www.scala-sbt.org/</a></p>

<p>Note: if you have SBT already installed on your system, you can
also just call it directly with "sbt" in <code>CHALK_DIR</code>.</p>

<h2>Trying it out</h2>

<p>Assuming you have completed all of the above steps, including running the "compile" action in SBT, you should now be able to try out some examples. There is no documentation specific to Chalk at this time, but you should be able to follow the OpenNLP documentation:</p>

<p><a href="http://opennlp.apache.org/documentation/1.5.2-incubating/manual/opennlp.html">http://opennlp.apache.org/documentation/1.5.2-incubating/manual/opennlp.html</a></p>

<p>However, you'll need to substitute 'chalk cli' for 'opennlp' in that manual. Here's an example to do sentence detection.</p>

<pre><code>    $ echo "Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29. Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group. Rudolph Agnew, 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, was named a director of this British industrial conglomerate." &gt; input.txt

    $ wget http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/en-sent.bin

    $ chalk cli SentenceDetector en-sent.bin &lt; input.txt
